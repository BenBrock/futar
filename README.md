# futar

Futar is a collection of utilities for generic future composition in C++.  Future composition is the practice of combining futures together to form a chain of futures, or a control flow graph.  Generic future composition allows the user to combine futures from many different libraries.  This allows users to expose the asynchrony present in their applications, using asynchronous libraries for I/O, threading, and networking together.
